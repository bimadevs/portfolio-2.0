Hello, world! 👋

I'm Bima Jovanta, an indie developer who loves building things that help other developers build faster and better.

Today, I'm super excited to introduce *not just one*, but *two* open source projects I've been working on under [BimaDev](https://bimadev.xyz) — both designed to help developers save time, learn, and create awesome stuff.

## 1. UI Components Library — [ui.bimadev.xyz](https://ui.bimadev.xyz)

A simple, customizable, and ready-to-use collection of UI components built for modern web development.

### Features
- Clean & modern design
- Easy to customize
- Copy-paste ready components
- Built with Tailwind CSS
- No complicated setup

This project was born from my own struggle of copy-pasting UI snippets from everywhere and ending up with inconsistent designs. Now, I just go here, copy, paste, done.

## 2. Source Code Library — [sc.bimadev.xyz](https://sc.bimadev.xyz)

A growing collection of free and premium source code templates, snippets, and utilities for web developers.

### What you'll find:
- Portfolio templates
- AI tools
- Frontend
- Backend
- FullStack
- And more coming soon...

This library is perfect for learning by example, speeding up your workflow, or simply getting inspired for your next project.

## Why Open Source?

Because I believe that sharing knowledge and tools makes the developer community stronger. 

Both of these projects are open source — and contributions, feedback, or even just a star ⭐ are always welcome!

## What's Next?

I'm planning to keep improving both projects and create other project open sorce:
- Adding more components
- Adding more useful code examples
- Better documentation

Stay tuned!
