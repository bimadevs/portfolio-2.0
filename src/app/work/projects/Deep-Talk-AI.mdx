> "Sometimes, you just need someone (or something) to talk to."

Hey there, it's Bima again!

This time, I want to share another experimental project I built: [Deep Talk AI](https://deep-talk-ai.vercel.app) — a simple chatbot powered by AI for fun conversations.

---

## What is Deep Talk AI?

It's a minimalistic AI chat app.

No complex setup. No login walls. No weird UI.

Just open the site, start call, and talk to AI like you're chatting with a friend (but less judgemental).

---

## Why I Built This?

Honestly, I built it just for fun — but also for learning.

- Playing with AI conversation design
- Practicing API integration
- Exploring minimal UI/UX for chatbots
- Making something lightweight & fast

Sometimes dev projects don’t need to be too serious, right? This is one of those.
